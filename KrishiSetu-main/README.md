## 📌 Problem Statement

Small and medium-scale agricultural producers face recurring systemic challenges:

* **Intermediary Dependency:** Heavy reliance on local commission agents and traders leads to diminished profit margins for farmers.
* **Price Opacity:** Absence of accessible, real-time market price benchmarks (APMC/MSP) leads to exploitation.
* **Uncertain Demand:** Farmers struggle to connect directly with bulk commercial buyers prior to harvest.
* **Procurement Inefficiencies:** Buyers struggle to locate consistent, reliable agricultural suppliers with verified quality produce.
* **Fragmented Comparison:** Lack of a centralized platform to evaluate produce availability, location, and pricing.

* **Trust & Reputation System:** Transparent user ratings and reviews following order completion.

## 🏷️ Pricing System

KrishiSetu equips buyers and farmers with a **Smart Price Indicator** that dynamically evaluates listing prices against market benchmarks using rule-based metrics:

| Indicator | Classification | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🟢 **Fair Price** | Market Aligned | Farmer asking price closely matches prevailing APMC market rates. |
| 🟡 **Below Market** | High Value | Farmer asking price is below prevailing APMC market rates. |
| 🔴 **Above Market** | Premium Pricing | Farmer asking price exceeds prevailing APMC market rates (often reflecting premium quality). |

> ℹ️ *Note: The current MVP utilizes rule-based numerical comparisons against static/updated APMC database records.*

## 🗄️ Supabase Database Schema

The underlying Supabase PostgreSQL database consists of 5 core relational tables:

* `profiles` — User profile information, role assignments (`farmer`, `buyer`, `admin`), and verification status (`verified`, `pending`).
* `listings` — Crop produce listings (crop type, quantity, asking price, APMC rate ref, harvest date, location).
* `offers` — Price negotiations submitted by buyers (`offered_price`, `offered_quantity`, `status`).
* `orders` — Confirmed purchase transactions (`status`: `pending`, `confirmed`, `picked_up`, `completed`).
* `market_prices` — APMC mandi reference prices and Government Minimum Support Prices (MSP).
